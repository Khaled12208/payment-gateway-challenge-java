# Payment Gateway Application

This project is a Spring Boot application that implements a Payment Gateway. It communicates with a bank system using `RestTemplate` via MockServer, running on port 1080. The application includes Spring Security for authentication, and Spring Validation with a custom error-handling library to ensure robust input validation and error management.

# Requirements

The product requirements for this initial phase are the following:

- A merchant should be able to process a payment through the payment gateway and receive one of the following types of response:
  - **Authorized**: The payment was authorized by the call to the acquiring bank.
  - **Declined**: The payment was declined by the call to the acquiring bank.
  - **Rejected**: No payment could be created as invalid information was supplied to the payment gateway, and therefore, it has rejected the request without calling the acquiring bank.

- A merchant should be able to retrieve the details of a previously made payment.

# Processing a Payment

The payment gateway will need to provide merchants with a way to process a card payment. To do this, the merchant should be able to submit a request to the payment gateway. A payment request must include the following fields:

# Payment Information Validation Rules

The following table outlines the validation rules and additional notes for each field in the payment information:
